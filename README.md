# Rust-Blog-Advance
Rust-Blog-Advance is a comprehensive blog platform leveraging the power of Rust for both backend and frontend development.

## Backend
The backend is powered by:

Rocket: A powerful, type-safe web framework for routing and API handling.
Rocket DB Pools: A convenient integration of database connection pooling, coupled with Diesel, a safe and high-performance ORM for managing SQL-based databases.
Argon2: Used for secure password hashing, enhancing user security.
jsonwebtoken: Provides JWT-based authentication for secure, stateless sessions.
The frontend is built using Yew, a modern, ergonomic framework for creating web apps with WebAssembly. Key features include:

## Frontend
Yew-Router: Efficiently handles client-side routing and page transitions.
Gloo-Net: Provides simple and effective means to make HTTP requests to the backend API.
Gloo-Storage: Allows seamless client-side data storage and caching for improved performance and user experience.

## Conclusion
Together, these technologies provide a fast, secure, and scalable solution for building modern, full-stack Rust applications.
